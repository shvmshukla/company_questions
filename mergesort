/*
The complexity of merge sort is O(nlogn).

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Think of it in terms of 3 steps -

The divide step computes the midpoint of each of the sub-arrays. Each of this step just takes O(1) time.
The conquer step recursively sorts two subarrays of n/2 (for even n) elements each.
The merge step merges n elements which takes O(n) time.
Now, for steps 1 and 3 i.e. between O(1) and O(n), O(n) is higher. Let's consider steps 1 and 3 take O(n) time in total. Say it is cn for some constant c.

How many times are these steps executed?

For this, look at the tree below - for each level from top to bottom Level 2 calls merge method on 2 sub-arrays of length n/2 each. The complexity here is 2 * (cn/2) = cn Level 3 calls merge method on 4 sub-arrays of length n/4 each. The complexity here is 4 * (cn/4) = cn and so on ...

Now, the height of this tree is (logn + 1) for a given n. Thus the overall complexity is (logn + 1)*(cn). That is O(nlogn) for the merge sort algorithm.
